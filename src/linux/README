INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------
Install the dependencies, extract this tar, install, run, configure

It should look something like this:

On Debian/*buntu/mint/etc-

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pyudev python3-setuptools python3-tk python3-imaging ifplugd python3-dbus
sudo easy_install3 IMAPClient
tar -xvzf Lockwatcher*
cd Lockwatcher*
sudo python3 setup.py install
sudo lockwatcherd start
lockwatcher-gui

On fedora and its brethren:

sudo yum install python3 ifplugd python3-setuptools python3-tkinter python3-pillow python3-dbus
sudo easy_install-3.3 IMAPClient pyudev
tar -xvzf Lockwatcher*
cd Lockwatcher*
sudo python3 setup.py install
sudo lockwatcherd start
lockwatcher-gui

SENSORS
-------------------
While support from RAM temperature monitoring is in the works (it isn't), support is available
for motherboard temperature monitoring in case whoever is freezing your ram also gets coolant over
the motherboard thermometer or something?

It isn't included by default because I couldn't get the install to put the compiled sensors library
in the right place in a system independent way and compiling it from source makes installation much
more of a pain in the neck. 

If you want it the install lm sensors:

debian: sudo apt-get install lm-sensors
fedora: sudo yum install lm_sensors

You also need to install the pysensors module from here: http://bitbucket.org/bastienleonard/pysensors
Or put the relevant precompiled binary from https://github.com/ncatlin/lockwatcher 
in your python3.3/dist-packages directory
